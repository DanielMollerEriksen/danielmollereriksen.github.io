## About Me
Welcome to my website! I'm Daniel MÃ¸ller Eriksen, a Ph.D. fellow at Aarhus University. 

My research focuses broadly on political communication with a strong focus on social media. I am particularly interested in party competition, agenda-setting, and the personalization of politics. Needless to say, I have a strong interested in computational text analysis. 

In my PhD, I'm currently developing -and launching empirically- a theoretical framework for understanding the mechanisms behind how political parties and their politicians use social media channels to influence the political agenda on social media and beyond. However, as I'm also working on other stuff, I suggest you take a look at the projects section!
