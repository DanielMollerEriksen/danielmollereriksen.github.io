## About Me
Welcome to my website! I'm Daniel MÃ¸ller Eriksen, a Ph.D. fellow at Aarhus University. 

My research focuses broadly on political communication with a strong focus on social media. I am particularly interested in party competition, agenda-setting, and the personalization of politics. Needless to say, I have a strong interested in computational text analysis. 

In my PhD, I'm currently developing -and launching empirically- a theoretical framework for understanding the mechanisms behind how political parties and their politicians use social media channels to influence the political agenda on social media and beyond. However, as I'm also working on other stuff, I suggest you take a look at the projects section!

## Projects

### Project 1: Social Media Influence in Election Campaigns

**Description:** Investigating how political parties leverage social media to influence public opinion during election campaigns. The project involves analyzing Twitter data, sentiment analysis, and identifying key influencers.

### Project 2: Computational Text Analysis Toolkit

**Description:** Developing a toolkit for computational text analysis in political communication research. This includes tools for sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and language processing tailored for political discourse.

### Project 3: Personalization of Political Messages

**Description:** Examining how political messages are personalized on social media platforms. This project involves studying the language and content of political messages to understand how personalized communication impacts public perception.

Feel free to explore each project to learn more about the specific goals, methodologies, and outcomes.
